<h2>Reasoning over beliefs</h2>

<blockquote id="bq" style="font-size:0.5em">
    If we were to examine the relationships among all of our beliefs carefully, an impossible task
    in practice but one that is interesting to think about, we would see that some of them should
    make others more credible and some less. They would even compete among themselves with
    conflicting influences. We can imagine all of the beliefs in our large network of beliefs “fighting
    it out” to agree finally on the strength of each belief in the network. When they do finally agree,
    we say that the beliefs cohere.
